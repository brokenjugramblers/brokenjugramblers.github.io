We have been performing on the streets and in the bars of Berlin since 2015. Our current line-up consists of Jon on banjo and mandolin, Felix on the washtub base, Tobi on the guitar, Alex on fiddle and Tuz on spoons. In U-bahn stations, smokey clubs and our friend's living rooms, we bring to life the tales of times gone by. We sometimes mix our own material with some old-timey traditionals. We are looking forward to realease our new album, Whiskey Store, on April 27th. Join us for the album release party!
